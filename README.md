# 🎀 Happy Question Generator 🎲

Hi there! 👋 This is a little web app I made with love 💖 for my wife. It’s a simple, fun, and functional tool to randomly generate practice questions from 14 chapters of study material.

## 🌟 What Does It Do?

With just one click of the magical **🎲 Generate Questions** button, this page will:

- 🔘 Create a new quiz table
- 📚 Questions are selected randomly based on predefined chapter sizes
- 📅 Each table shows the timestamp of when it was created
- 📌 Each question appears as a clickable button
- ❌ Tapping a question marks it as incorrect (red)
- 🎯 Score is calculated and displayed as a percentage based on incorrect answers
- 🧹 "Clear All" button to reset all data
- 💾 All generated tables are saved using `localStorage`, so they won’t disappear on refresh
- 📱 Fully responsive and mobile-friendly
- 🥰 Includes fun emojis to make the experience delightful

Each time she clicks the button, a new table appears at the top — so she can generate as many sets as she likes!
