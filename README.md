# 🎀 Happy Question Generator 🎲

Hi there! 👋 This is a little web app I made with love 💖 for my wife. It’s a simple, fun, and functional tool to randomly generate practice questions from 14 chapters of study material.

## 🌟 What Does It Do?

With just one click of the magical **🎲 Generate Questions** button, this page will:

- Randomly pick questions from each chapter based on preset limits.
- Show them nicely in a cute little table.
- Display the time the questions were generated ⏰ (so we know when the magic happened).
- Keep every set of questions forever (or until she hits the 🧹 "Clear All" button).
- Work beautifully on mobile phones! 📱

Each time she clicks the button, a new table appears at the top — so she can generate as many sets as she likes!
